    <h1>Daily Greeting Cards</h1>

    <p>
        Daily Greeting Cards is a creator-focused project that explores the generation, 
        organization, and presentation of greeting card visuals. The project provides tools 
        and workflows that help creators prepare and structure visual content for use across 
        different platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
        This website serves as the main information hub for the project. It includes 
        documentation, data protection details, and general information required for 
        third‑party platform reviews.

    <h2>Project Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of Daily Greeting Cards is to support creators in managing their visual 
        content. The tools do not automate posting or perform actions on behalf of users. 
        Instead, they help with preparing, organizing, and structuring greeting card visuals 
        in a creator‑friendly workflow.

    <h2>Future Development</h2>
    <p>
        As the project evolves, this website will expand to include examples, creator 
        resources, and additional tools. It may also serve as the central hub for future 
        monetization options such as downloadable card packs, creator memberships, or 
        educational material.
